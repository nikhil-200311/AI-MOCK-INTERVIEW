## Getting Started

To start the project, navigate to the Dashboard section for detailed instructions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

1. **Create a Next.js Application:**

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest
   cd your-next-app
   ```

2. **Install Necessary Libraries:**

   ```bash
   npm install @clerk/nextjs tailwindcss postgresql drizzle-orm google-gemini-api
   ```

## Authentication Setup

Implement social and email/password authentication with Clerk:

1. **Sign up for Clerk:**

   Go to [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) and create an account.

2. **Setup Clerk in your Next.js App:**

   Follow the Clerk documentation to configure Clerk with your Next.js app. You will need to add your Clerk API keys to your environment variables and initialize Clerk in your app.

## Styling with TailwindCSS

1. **Install TailwindCSS:**

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. **Configure TailwindCSS:**

   Update your `tailwind.config.js` and CSS files as per the TailwindCSS documentation.

## Database Setup

1. **Install PostgreSQL:**

   Follow the instructions for your operating system to install PostgreSQL.

2. **Setup Drizzle ORM:**

   ```bash
   npm install drizzle-orm
   ```

   Configure Drizzle ORM to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Create your database models and run migrations.

## AI Integration

1. **Setup Google Gemini API:**

   Follow the Google Gemini API documentation to create an account and get your API keys.

2. **Generate AI Form:**

   Use the Google Gemini API to generate AI-powered forms. Follow the API documentation to integrate it into your app.

## Recording and Saving User Responses

1. **Record User Answer Using Web and Microphone:**

   Implement functionality to record user answers using the Web Audio API.

2. **Convert Speech to Text:**

   Use a speech-to-text API to convert recorded audio to text.

3. **Save User Response:**

   Save the user's responses to your PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

## Deployment

Deploy your app on Vercel:

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   Follow the prompts to deploy your app.
